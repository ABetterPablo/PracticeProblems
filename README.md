# PracticeProblems
Here's where I'll find out wth a repository is
# Projects

All the projects that I'll be trying to solve (for now) are taken from this webpage:

https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises

I'm aware that they all have the solution written just below them, but I'll be trying to not read them haha

Best of luck to me! - 30/09/2018
